This project is to simple that any newbie can understand.
I have coded this script in python v3.9.1 and used Visual Code Terminal for execution process.
This works fine,
	1.	It will ask you to input a video link.
	2.	It provide a you a Title,Author,Views detatils about video.
	3.	A list having different streams shows up and ask you to select one of them
	4.	It will downlad that stream for You. promt a message that download completed.

Boom! You have downloaded the video. 


I have used pytube, requests, sys modules
as
import pytube and so on.
you could get these installed simply by 

	1.	open cmd : windows users
	2.	type:	pip install pytube
					pip install requests
Hope you will enjoye this project.
